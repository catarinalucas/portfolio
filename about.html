        <p>I've always loved magic<br>
          and I believe that design does magic with the everyday things of our life.<br>
          I've been working hard to inspire people to be better, to do better,<br>
          because I always had people who inspired me.<br>
        </p>
        <p>I was born in 97' and raised in Viseu, Portugal and I was that boring kid who asks the purpose of everything</p>
