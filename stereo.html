        <p>Stereognosis is a digital &amp; phisical magazine based on the articles and wisdom of The Whole Earth Catalog,
        wish was as an American counterculture magazine and product catalog.
        <br>We have developed a magazine in the image of our brain which contains
          two hemispheres, left and right, one connected to science and logical reasoning
           and another connected to art respectively. As you navigate in the magazine to the right
           the articles are consequently becoming more artistic and with space dedicated to the image.</p>
           <p>To illustrate these two parallels, the magazine has a physical dimension and a web dimension, and a website has been created for this purpose.</p>
